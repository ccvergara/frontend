Badger Frontend
============

test

The publicly available frontend for Badger. Feel free to submit pull requests, we always welcome input from the community.

### Run locally:
* ```git clone https://github.com/badger/frontend.git```
* open **frontend/index.html** in your browser of choice.

### Badger JSON API
The Badger frontend is actually just a pretty interface for our JSON API, which you can read about here: https://api.badger.com. 

This really opens the door for developers to come in and customize their Badger experience. Everything that you can do through the frontend can also be done with cURL on a command line.
